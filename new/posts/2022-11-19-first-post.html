      <p>hey! welcome to my blog! this is where i'll talk about my personal life monthly. as of currently, life is okay, autumn break is next week. kind of nervous about the mri i have to get even though my family has constantly assured me that i will be okay. i seem to be doing actually okay in school compared to my middle school years (which were literally the worst years of my life for multiple reasons) & as of currently, i am in student government. i hope you enjoy this blog as much as i like writing this post! (a lot)</p>
