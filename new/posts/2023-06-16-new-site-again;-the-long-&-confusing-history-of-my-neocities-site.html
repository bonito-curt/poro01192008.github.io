      <p> so, today officially marks the opening of the "nuuk" version of my site. many of you may be wondering reading this post's title...</p>
      <blockquote>geez, i'm pretty fucking curious about this site now. what <b>is</b> it's history?</blockquote>
      <h3>chapter 1: beginnings (2019-2021)</h3>
      <p>this site would not be concieved until <b>MUCH</b> later. however, i discovered neocities in 2019 after trying to find somewhere to learn html. not sure why i chose this site specifically, but whatever. i completely forget the name of my old site. however, it had very basic css and html usage. eventually i <i>would</i> develop a better version of the site in 2021, then i forgot the username and password. i felt too tired to actually get my old site, and as so, i had officially decided to just make this account. </p>
      <h3>chapter 2: the matsuri era (2021-2022)</h3>
      <p>the first version of this site was known as matsuri, in which i made the first version, which i like to call "bloom" for it's background. i had used a modified version of the "jimmy's site" framework made by templaterr. i made it while i was extremely sick with covid. i had made the site not only to continue where i left off; but to also challenge myself to learn more than i had known. at this point, i began to learn css a <b>lot</b> more, learning basic styling and other stuff. it was released on september 28th, 2021.</p>

      <p>the other version of matsuri was what i like to call "basicblue" for it's blue background and more basic look. it was barely developed, and was to me a huge downgrade from the other. it released in october 2021.</p>

      <i>the only capture of the website i have.</i>
      <p>after this, i decided to take a break, and essentially wipe the website. i did not log on for around a year. i gave up on html, and began to use carrd. i know it was very low for me to just give up and use carrd, but at that time i was fairly depressed and had a bunch of shit going on. that was until i decided to give html a try again.</p>
      <h3>chapter 3: the comeback era (2022-2023)</h3>
      <p>after a lot of decisions, i decided to give html another try, with a version of the site i'll call yakutsk. i had then made what would eventually be the eventual basic framework for iqaluit. i made a simple website with not much to offer. it was just eh, however i did get way better than i was when i stopped learning html. i was finally picking up again, doing better than i was! i decided eventually it was time to give the site a makeover; and so i did. i also made the first blog post!</p>
      <h3>chapter 4: iqaluit (2023)</h3>
      <p>i decided i would import a lot of what existed in yakutsk, and renovate it for an easier and straightforward experience. i would use another font for my "branding," and just try and make the site more modern. nothing much to say other than a few blog posts.</p>
      <h3>chapter 5: now</h3>
      <p>i plan on doing more with this website eventually, like adding easy html importing for less tacky html files. however, i'm really proud of myself for completing this in just a full day. doro out!</p>
